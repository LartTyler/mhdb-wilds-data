v0.229: (2025-02-28)
- Added support for extracting the texture DLC PAK for Monster Hunter Wilds (thanks gibbed!).

v0.228: (2024-11-25)
- Fixed a very silly bug that broke PAK extraction.

v0.227: (2024-10-04)
- Changed warning message when failing to extract PAK due to invalidated entries and added a flag to bypass it: -forceExtract

v0.226: (2024-10-03)
- When creating a PAK, there's now text output indicating what games current version is meant for.
- Added batch files for generating PAK files for old and newer RE Engine titles.

v0.225: (2024-03-22)
- Fix for a major bug where created PAK files would be missing one file entry.

v0.224: (2024-03-18)
- When creating a PAK, it's now possible to include files with unknown paths if they have the hash in the filename. These files are read from the "__UNKNOWN" directory.
- When extracting a PAK, files with an unknown filepath are now written to the "__UNKNOWN" directory. Various formats will be written to unique subdirectories.
- When creating a PAK, a manifest file will automatically be created that contains the real path for every file entry added to the PAK (manifest hash is based on this path: "__MANIFEST/MANIFEST.TXT").
- When extracting a PAK, it will check for a manifest and, if it exists, use that as hash list.
- Added "-noManifest" argument for preventing the creation and usage of manifests.
- Allow hash lists entries that don't start with "natives".
- Hash list reading routines now only check for duplicates when outputting a new hash list. This leads to an enormous speedup as this routine wasn't amazingly written.
- Tweaked message telling user a PAK is encrypted so it sounds less like an error message.

v0.223: (2024-03-09)
- Added correct calculation of file entry checksums for compressed files when creating PAK archives (thanks to gibbed and ekey for figuring out the hash algorithm). This make custom PAKs compatible with Dragon's Dogma 2 Character Creator.
- File entries are now sorted by filename hash when creating a PAK archive.
- Added -neverCompress argument for never compressing files during PAK creation.
- Added -alwaysCompress argument for always compressing files during PAK creation.
- Added -version [major] [minor] argument for defining PAK version when creating a PAK.

v0.222: (2023-12-20)
- Fixed calculation of TEX width that could result in some TEX files being not properly converted to DDS.

v0.221: (2023-11-01)
- Fixed TEX->DDS conversion of textures with a padded width (this applies to many UI textures in new RE Engine titles).
- Added support for rare TEX type variants during DDS->TEX conversion when resolution was different from the original TEX.
- Added "-keepWidth" argument which will make the TEX keep its width defined in the header rather than saving the width of the image data..
- Added "-savedWidth [width]" argument which will apply a user-defined width to the TEX header rather than saving the width of the image data.

v0.220: (2023-08-31)
- Added -replaceTex argument that will make REtool replace the input TEX file during texture size reduction mode.
- Made DDS->TEX conversion always use input TEX filename as output filename rather than use extension from TEX header.

v0.219: (2023-07-06)
- The resulting TEX file during DDS->TEX conversion will now use the exact same filename as the template TEX file.

v0.218: (2023-04-14)
- REtool now outputs a warning when trying to extract a modded PAK archive.

v0.217: (2023-04-12)
- Fixed reading in hash lists where each line starts wih a hash number.

v0.216: (2023-03-24)
- Fixed a potential crash when extracting encrypted PAK archives.
- Added support for outputting a trimmed file list that contains only matching paths in a PAK file. Usage: -trimlist -h [filelist] -l [pakfile]

v0.215: (2022-10-05)
- Added support for decrypting PAKs for MHR on PC. 
- Added support for creating PAK file by using the "-c" argument.
- Updated guessing of file extensions when extracting files with unknown paths from an archive.

v0.213: (2021-05-04)
- Fixed DDS to TEX conversion of RE8 textures when mipmap count or DDS type is different.
- Fixed "-texReduce" option when using RE8 textures.
- Added a new toggle "-keepBC7type" which will leave a texture type alone when converting a BC7 DDS to BC7 TEX. I added this because I'm using a DDS converter that only ever outputs DXGI_FORMAT_BC7_UNORM while RE Engine BC7 textures are (always?) DXGI_FORMAT_BC7_UNORM_SRGB.

v0.212: (2021-04-08)
- Improved TEX support so TEX files from ReVerse can be converted.
- When guessing extension names during extraction, it now always guesses the correct extension for TEX files.

v0.211: (2020-12-28)
- Added more formats REtool can "guess" the extensions of during PAK extraction with unknown filepaths.
- Fixed a typo related to the extension "guessing" (PFB should be PFB, not PBF).
- Fixed DDS->TEX conversion which broke as result of fixing a bug related to large directories in the previous version.

v0.209: (2020-12-26)
- Fixed a bug where REtool wouldn't correctly read from folders with a large amount of files (more than 20k) when invalidating entries in a PAK file.
- Made it possible to specify directory and PAK file when in invalidation mode (you can still use the old system of defining only the directory, with PAK filename being guessed based on the directory name).
- Added a variant to the invalidation mode (-iAlt) which is meant to be used to define an input directory name which starts at "natives" (that way you can use the same input directory for multiple PAK files).
- Added a toggle (-noExtractDir) which will extract PAK files to the current directory rather than making directory with the same name as the PAK file and extracting to that.

v0.208: (2020-12-15)
- When extracting files with an unknown filename from a PAK file, RETool will guess its extension by looking at data in the file.

v0.207: (2020-10-31)
- When converting from DDS to TEX, it's now possible to use DDS textures of any resolution, any mip count, and most compression formats, and the TEX file will be updated accordingly.

v0.206: (2020-08-26)
- Added "texInfo [file]" command for outputting all header info from a TEX file.
- Added "texReduce [file]" command for reducing the resolution of a TEX file. By default it will get divided by 4 (ie, 2048x2048 > 512x512) and the flags value in the header will be modified to include the "low res texture" flag so it can be used as non-stream texture. This is a good method for easily making lowres variants of textures when packaging a mod. Note that this only works with textures containing multiple mipmaps.
- Added "texReduceBy [#]" command for overriding the above default for texture resolution reduction. I recommend 4 as that's what Capcom seems to use for most or all textures.

v0.202: (2020-04-07)
- Added "dontOverwrite" command line argument which skips existing files when extracting from a PAK file.

v0.201: (2019-12-25)
- Fixed an issue which would lead to a very low amount of files never being able to be extracted or added to file lists due to them sharing hash with another file (to fix this, the tool now compares two hash numbers).
- Due to the above, the file lists generated by REtool are no longer compatible with the old RE Engine PAK extraction quickbms script.

v0.200: (2019-12-15)
- Fixed a bug preventing the tool from extracting files from PAK archives with one or more space characters.
- Fixed a minor bug preventing the tool from displaying 64-bit numbers when outputting information about a PAK archive.
- Made it possible for the tool to convert all found TEX files to DDS when unpacking a PAK archive (add "-tex" as command line argument).
